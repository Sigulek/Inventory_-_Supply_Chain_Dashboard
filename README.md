# Inventory & Supply Chain Performance Dashboard
## Mockup Project Overview: 
Created an interactive dashboard to monitor stock levels and supplier performance, preventing stockouts that impact customer satisfaction and business revenue.
##Data & Methodology: Working with three datasets (products, inventory transactions, supplier deliveries), I used MySQL to perform complex analysis including:
* Data aggregation and joins to calculate current stock levels
* CASE statements to separate incoming vs outgoing inventory
* Date functions to analyze supplier delivery performance
* Business logic to identify reorder thresholds
## Key Findings:
* Critical Alert: Identified 7 products with negative inventory (oversold items requiring immediate restocking)
* Supplier Optimization: GrindHouse delivers 19.98% faster than the median, making them ideal for urgent orders
* Inventory Flow: Monthly trends reveal seasonal patterns for better purchasing decisions
## Dashboard Features:
* Real-time reorder alerts with conditional formatting for priority visualization
* Supplier performance comparison charts for procurement decisions
* Interactive slicers enabling product-specific trend analysis
* Monthly inventory flow tracking for demand forecasting
Business Impact: This tool addresses critical operational challenges by preventing stockouts, optimizing supplier selection, and reducing employee stress while protecting revenue and customer relationships.
